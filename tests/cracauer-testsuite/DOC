The scripts './test01.sh' to './test05.sh' all echo to stdout what
they should do and what behaviour is expected. Test them interactivly.

Do a 'make' first to build a sample program that makes use of SIGQUIT
and SIGINT. Links the shell to test to './testshell' or './testcsh'.

Remember to 
   stty quit '^\'
after each test. It seens resetting the terminal sometimes doesn't
reset the keys as well.

The file OBSERVATIONS contains the misbehaviour I found.
