This is Geoff Collyer's `sh' regression test.  It will run each test
on sh and ../../bash, and on ksh if you have it.  I have `real' ksh;
the PD ksh is different and will fail some of the tests.

Expect some small variations in the sh and bash output, since some
of the tests work from the output of `date' or on the current dat
returned by `getdate'.

Don't expect `getdate' to exist unless you're running C News.  If you
don't have it, run

	make -f getdate.mk getdate
